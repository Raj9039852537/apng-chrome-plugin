# apng-chrome-plugin
Plugin for Apng files to use with Google Chrome


File is created by Mr. Davidmz(http://github.com/davidmz/apng-canvas)
User script format can be used via apng.user.js file by dragging the same in your browser's extention page. 
As for zip file it is in chrome extension format and could be used by renaming the extension of the file to crx or loading the same via load unpack extension mode (enable developer-mode on extension page.)
all credits for creating the script goes to Mr.Davidmz

As for Internet Explorer users a simple workaround exist for every script --- 
loading it via creating a bookmark (Faviorate) with following content 

<code>javascript:(function () {var s = document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('src', '----Path to your js file');document.body.appendChild(s);}());</code>

Does not forget to change the path in the bookmark
